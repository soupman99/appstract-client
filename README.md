Install both the server & client repos in order to get things working.
### Install & run : server
```sh
git clone https://github.com/soupman99/appstract-server.git
cd appstract-server && npm i
npm run start
```

### Install & run : client
```sh
git clone https://github.com/soupman99/appstract-client.git
cd appstract-client && npm i
npm run start
```

### TODOS
* Clean up webpack build process to only need 1 set of files for electron run rather than dev & prod
